        <p>Useful is an app started by a sober lonely developer who thought it would be great to store information regarding FE meetings or projects or any general useful information. It was a great way to start learning ES6 and Vue JS</p>

        <p>The idea is you create a useful card where it will be kept for future reading for other developers to learn and reasearch new ways of doing code.</p>

        <h2 class="title is-3 ">What Can I do?</h2>

        <i>"Ask not what your team can do for you, but what you can do for your team"</i>

        <p>Sooo currently this project is bare, it has been set up with a form where we can create some useful tips. It has some basic functionalty for it to work and has been set up with an API.</p>

        <p> BUT WHY STOP THERE MAN!! </p>

        <p>There is a number of things left that can make this project great make our life easy.
        </p>
        <p> Just to list a few:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Search, </li>
          <li>Form validation,</li>
          <li>Differnet fields,</li>
          <li>Better styling,</li>
          <li>ETC....</li>
