      <p>Useful is an app started by a sober lonely developer who thought it would be great to store information regarding FE
        meetings or projects or any general useful information. It was a great way to start learning ES6 and Vue JS</p>

      <p>The idea is you create a useful card where it will be kept for future reading for other developers to learn and reasearch
        new ways of doing code.</p>
